# Model Card

This model is built for learning maching learning with pipelines. This project is completed as part of a data analytics degree with WGU and Udacity.

## Model Details

The model uses a random forest classifier on us census data. 
– This model is built by Patricia Walker (WGU/Udacity)
– This model was built on 11/28/2025.
– This is the initial version at Version 1.0.
– Model type
– Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features
– Where to send questions or comments about the model

## Intended Use
The model is intended for educational purposes only.

## Training Data
– The dataset for this project was provided and comes from US Census data
– Preprocessing was provided as part of the pre-built functions provided to me and includes One Hot Encodding and labelbinarizer

## Evaluation Data
– The dataset for this project was provided and comes from US Census data
– Preprocessing was provided as part of the pre-built functions provided to me and includes One Hot Encodding and labelbinarizer

## Metrics
– Model performance measures
– Decision thresholds
– Variation approaches
Precision: 0.7382 | Recall: 0.6295 | F1: 0.6795

## Ethical Considerations
There are no ethical consideratins associated with the model, the census data is no longer accurate based on the age of the data. 

## Caveats and Recommendations
Additional enhancements could be made to the model to drive even better performance. A next step maybe to try different classifiers to see if others perform better.
